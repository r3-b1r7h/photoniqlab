# PhotoniQLAB

## Introduction

PhotoniQLAB is a Python framework for simulating photonic quantum information processing (PQIP) experiments by an algebraic approach.

As we know, the scale and complexity of PQIP experiments grow rapidly.
The time-consuming and error-prone analyzing process for these complex experiments keeps annoying researchers.
Typically **hours of time and cooperator's rechecking** is needed to verify the correctness of an analysis.

Here comes PhotoniQLAB, a systematic software solution for the pain point.

We have also achieved more appealing goals in PhotoniQLAB beyond its basic duty:

- üîß Virtual photonic-lab-style user experience. You can specify a experiment in the similar way of building up the experimental setup in a real lab.
- ‚ôæÔ∏è Universality. More than 60 existing PQIP experiments involving multiple encoded degree of freedoms covering various subareas have been simulated by PhotoniQLAB.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Being efficient enough for most near-term use cases. Because PhotoniQLAB's creative operators manipulation system is strong but light-weight.

For more details of its context, please refer to our paper linked in the section of citation.

## Installation

You can install our package by the following command under a Python 3.6 environment.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

To get started with PhotoniQLAB to simulate a PQIP experiment, you need to create a Python script, e.g. `yourscript.py`, and describe the target PQIP experiment according to the step-by-step tutorial in PhotoniQLAB paper shown in the section of citation.

You can run the Python script to perform the simulation by the following command.

```bash
python yourscript.py
```

After the simulation process finished, you can get some output pdf files containing the simulation results. The content of each file is described by the following table.

| File name | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `init_state.pdf` | The initial state of the network |
| `after_layerX.pdf`   | The quantum state after X layers |
| `post_selected.pdf`   | The quantum state after post selection |
| `experiment.pdf`   | The schematic diagram of the network |

## Simulate real-life examples

### Hong-Ou-Mandel dip experiment

The experiment setup of Hong-Ou-Mandel dip experiment (see <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1711.00080>) is shown as follows.

The PhotoniQLAB code for simulate this experiment is shown as follows.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from photoniqlab.sympy_widget import *
from photoniqlab import Experiment, Photons, Detectors, BD, BS, HWP, PBS, POL, PS, QWP

expt = Experiment()

p1 = Photons(1, ['path'], co('p1'))
p2 = Photons(1, ['path'], co('p1'))

bs = BS()

expt.add_sources(p1, p2)
expt.add_elements(bs)

p1.o[0] = bs.i[0]
p2.o[0] = bs.i[1]

expt.build()
expt.simulate()
```

PhotoniQLAB draws a schematic diagram of the experiment setup to help you debug your description.

PhotoniQLAB outputs the final quantum state of this experiment into a PDF file by the representation of creative operators.

From the result we can verify that the cases of outputting two photons at two sides simultaneously have been cancelled out.
